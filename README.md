# LogiZoom
Windows Magnifier Mouse Shortcut

## ZoomHorizScroll
This is a compiled [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/ "AutoHotKey's Homepage") script that makes horizontal scroll do the zooming for you. Particularly helpful with mice that don't have it built in (like my Logitech MX Master).

+ Scroll right (up on MX Master) - Zoom to default zoom level (dynamic) [Win +]
+ Scroll left (down on MX Master) - Exit magnifier [Win Escape]

Use Ctrl+Alt+Normal scroll wheel to change zoom level. Be aware that "default" zoom is whatever the last zoom level was.
